Development was done with VS as a c# console application.
.Net framework was used. If you want to make a simple console application with C#, you can check out this game.
The random object was used for both dice, but I get the impression that this was insufficient at some point and that the computer actually played the entire game alone. 
If you have anything to add to fix this, I'd be happy to hear it.
But other than that, it seems like a sufficient and understandable project to get started with the C# language, right?
